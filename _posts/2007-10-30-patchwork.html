<a href="http://oracledoug.com/serendipity/index.php?/archives/1330-The-Reality-Gap-1-Software-Maintenance.html">Doug Burns wrote a great piece</a> about how few people apply the latest patchsets and how almost no one applies the <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technology/deploy/security/alerts.htm">CPU</a>s.<br /><br />While my databases are all 10.2.0.2, I've only just begun looking at applying CPUs starting with the <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technology/deploy/security/critical-patch-updates/cpuoct2007.html">October CPU</a> (they are cumulative).<br /><br />We were also looking at finally upgrading to 10.2.0.3, then <a href="http://laurentschneider.com/wordpress/2007/10/next-patchset-for-oracle-10gr2.html">Laurent Schneider informed me</a> that <a href="https://metalink.oracle.com/metalink/plsql/f?p=130:14:6822438614146518802::::p14_database_id,p14_docid,p14_show_header,p14_show_help,p14_black_frame,p14_font:NOT,401436.1,1,1,1,helvetica">10.2.0.4</a> is due out this year.  Of course the reason we didn't upgrade to 10.2.0.3 when we had opportunities in the past was due to a lot of horror stories from the early adopters.
