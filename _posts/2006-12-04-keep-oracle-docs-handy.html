As I just shared in <a href="irc://chat.freenode.net/oracle">#oracle</a>, it really helps to have a handy <a href="http://www.oracle.com/pls/db102/homepage">bookmark to the Oracle documentation library</a> for your release.  Oracle really does a good job with its documentation and making it easily available and searchable.
