Recently stumbled upon Oracle's "<a href="http://awads.net/wp/2006/10/18/blogger-of-the-year-2006/">Blogger of the Year</a>", <a href="http://awads.net/wp/">Eddie Awad</a>.  Today I found out about his <a href="http://awads.net/wp/2005/11/21/oracle-docs-firefox-extension/">Oracle Docs Firefox Extension</a>, which also mentions his previous work on a <a href="http://awads.net/wp/2005/08/01/oracle-firefox-search-plugin/">search plugin</a> for firefox.<br /><br />It also works with Firefox 2!
