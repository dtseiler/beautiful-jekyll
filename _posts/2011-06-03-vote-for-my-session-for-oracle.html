Well I didn't make the judges cut, but through Oracle Mix's Suggest-A-Session, you can still send me to OOW by voting for my session, which is unofficially titled, "<a class="vt-p" href="https://mix.oracle.com/events/oow11/proposals/10904">Making Love to the ADR ... the Don Seiler Way</a>." The official title is much less romantic.<br /><br />Cheers!
