In re-working some old reports that I'm still maintaining, I decided to clean up instances of "WHERE foo > bar or foo is null" with some <a href="http://seilerwerks.blogspot.com/2007/02/lnnvl-ftw.html">LNNVL()</a> loving.  Given the nature of my query and of LNNVL(), I plugged in LNNVL(foo > bar) and prefaced it with a NOT, since LNNVL() will return false when I want thing to evaluate to true.  This was met with furious anger:<br /><pre><span style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0);">ORA-03113: end-of-file on communication channel</span></pre>It kills my database connection!  I headed over to <a href="http://metalink.oracle.com/">Metalink</a> and found Bug 4211527, reported over 2 years ago on 10gR1, with no workaround.  I confirmed the bug is still around in 10.2.0.3.  Back to the OR statement for me.
