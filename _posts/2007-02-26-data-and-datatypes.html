Somehow while reading through some Oracle blogs this weekend, I found myself re-reading a <a href="http://tkyte.blogspot.com/2006/11/see-you-just-cannot-make-this-stuff-up.html">post from Tom Kyte last year about mis-used datatypes</a>.  Such things as people using string datatypes to hold date values, or people using VARCHAR2(4000) for every field in every table.  Tom does a fantastic job (as always) explaining the many reasons this is just awful, including loss of data integrity and performance.<br /><br />Always worth a (re)read.
