It started with the <a href="http://icanhascheezburger.com/">LOLCATS</a>.   Then we had the <a href="http://www.orlyowl.com/">ORLY</a> thing and the "<a href="http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/index.php/I%27m_in_ur_base,_killin_ur_d00dz">in ur base</a>" thing.  It's all one big conglomeration now, and it has belched forth <a href="http://www.lolcode.com/">LOLCODE</a>.  I'm told there is a parser/compiler for LOLCODE, but my head hurts just thinking about it.<br /><br />But it does beg the question of when we'll see the Oracle extension of LOL/SQL and who will write it.  <a href="http://feuerthoughts.blogspot.com/">Steven</a>?
