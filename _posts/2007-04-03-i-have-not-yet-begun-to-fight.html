So sayeth <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Paul_Jones">John Paul Jones</a> (not <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Paul_Jones_%28musician%29">this one</a>), so sayeth I.<br /><br />I've been taking steps to make sure my developers know of the many <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/72_Virgins">benefits</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicorns">of</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacon">using</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer">bind</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pornography">variables</a>, and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drawing_and_quartering">punishments for not using bind variables</a>.  This is paying off in the newer code coming out, but it will take a while to re-write some of the older applications.<br /><br />Today, while tracing another query, I saw that one of the back office applications that dealt with batch rating was using a query without bind variables.  In the timeframe of 1 hour this morning, the same query with a different literal value was called over <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">21,000</span> times.  The same app was bulk issuing two other queries using literals as well.  Let's just say that <a href="http://www.kropserkel.com/horse_head_pillow.htm">it was made certain</a> that this needed to be changed.
