Getting slammed this week.  My production instance hanging for 10-15 minutes 2-3 times a day during business hours due to latching on the shared pool and library cache.  Oracle "support" seems to be reading from a "fix ur app codez kthxbye" script.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.jlcomp.demon.co.uk/kiddy_scripts.html#_Always_be_cautious_about_x$_and_v$">This post from Jonathan Lewis</a> describes the symptoms to a tee.<br /><br />I'll try to follow-up when we get past this.
