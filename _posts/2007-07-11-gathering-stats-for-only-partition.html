I'm sure you all know to use <a href="http://download.oracle.com/docs/cd/B19306_01/server.102/b14211/stats.htm#PFGRF30102">DBMS_STATS</a> to gather statistics for your tables and indexes.  The DBMS_STATS.GATHER_TABLE_STATS() method has as its first three parameters OWNNAME, TABNAME, and PARTNAME, specifying the schema owner name, table name, and table partition name, respectively.<br /><br />I had been assuming that specifying a partition name via the PARTNAME parameter would mean that I'd be gathering stats for just that partition.  Wrong!  You also need to specify GRANULARITY => PARTITION if that is your goal.  Otherwise the PARTNAME is simply ignored and global (table-wide) statistics will be gathered instead.<br /><br />Thanks to <a href="http://www.centrexcc.com/">Wolfgang Breitling</a> for the cluestick.
