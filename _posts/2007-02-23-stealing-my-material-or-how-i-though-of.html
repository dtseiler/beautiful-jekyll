This past Wednesday in <a href="irc://chat.freenode.net/oracle">#oracle</a>, I asked how one views what values are being used in a SQL statement with bind variables.  hali led me to <a href="http://download-east.oracle.com/docs/cd/B19306_01/server.102/b14237/dynviews_2114.htm#sthref4039">v$sql_bind_capture</a>.  We played with some joins to v$sql and v$session and all was well.  I immediately recognized the blog-worthiness of the discussion and tagged the concept for later blogging.<br /><br />Well <a href="http://halisway.blogspot.com/2007/02/viewing-bind-variable-values-in-10g.html">hali beat me to it</a>.  From now on I'll just start blogging about things before I even have all of the information.  For now you can read his post to see the usefulness of the v$ view.  And leave comments about how he's a dirty Scandinavian thief!
