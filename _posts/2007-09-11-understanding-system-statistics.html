<a href="http://www.ardentperf.com/">Jeremy Scheider</a>'s recent <a href="http://www.ardentperf.com/2007/09/02/formula-for-db_file_multiblock_read_count/">post about db_file_multiblock_read_count</a>, a great read in itself, linked me to piece that <a href="http://www.jlcomp.demon.co.uk/">Jonathan Lewis</a> wrote for Oracle's website entitled "<a href="http://www.oracle.com/technology/pub/articles/lewis_cbo.html">Understanding System Statistics</a>."<br /><br />Definitely a must-read for anyone taking charge of a 9i or 10g system.  I found myself needing to gather system stats again after migrating my database over to a new ZOMG DUAL CORE 64-BIT machine.  The numbers were a bit more impressive than the system stats on the old hardware, to say the least.  Let's hope that observed performance is equally impressive!
