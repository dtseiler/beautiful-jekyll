I hung up the Oracle spurs (and that sweet Oracle Ace vest) and threw on a pair of <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/" target="_blank">PostgreSQL</a> chaps. I had always been a fan and very casual user of PostgreSQL for many years, even gently lobbying the folks at <a href="http://www.pythian.com/" target="_blank">Pythian</a> to add PostgreSQL DBA services to their offering (to no avail).<br /><br />I'm taking this fresh start to also jump-start my blogging, hoping to write about interesting notes as I dive deeper in the PostgreSQL world (and even some Hadoop as I get into that). I'm just over 6 months into my new adventure and loving it. I'm excited to be dealing a lot more with an open source community, and interacting daily with some contributors via Slack.<br /><br />Over the past 6 months, I've compiled a list of topics to write about. If I can remember the details or find my notes, I'll hopefully be writing regularly on these topics!<br /><br />So, I hope to see more of you regularly here. Stay tuned!
