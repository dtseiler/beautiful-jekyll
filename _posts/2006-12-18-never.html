There is never, NEVER, N E V E R a reason to <a href="http://blog.moertel.com/articles/2006/12/15/never-store-passwords-in-a-database">store passwords as clear text in a database</a>.  No matter <a href="http://reddit.com/info/usqe/comments/cuugl">how convenient it is for your own personal preference</a>.<br /><br />Any aspiring application developers reading this:  NEVER.  Salt-n-hash is such an easy thing to do in most any language now, and you won't be publicly ridiculed like spez is now.
