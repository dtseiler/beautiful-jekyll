OK not really, but <a href="http://www.dizwell.com/prod/node/1">HJR</a> wants you to <a href="http://www.dizwell.com/prod/node/541">take caution</a> before assuming that ASSM is the second coming.  You probably don't want to use it in your direct-path/append-insert bulk loaded warehouse environment.<br /><br />I'm running a hybrid on 10gR2, and hope to fully use ASM when we migrate to the new 64-bit hardware (*drool*), so I'll have to do some testing on the bulk-loaded tables.
