I had to do a triple-take when I actually saw my name in print in the <a href="http://www.pythian.com/blogs/385/log-buffer-30-a-carnival-of-the-vanities-for-dbas">latest Pythian LogBuffer post</a>.  Then I had to re-read again to see if it was positive or negative.  It was just for my post linking to the SQL implementations page, but still fun.<br /><br />I was going to go with a Sally Field-esque acceptance speech, but I'll think it's better to go with the <a href="irc://chat.freenode.net/wilug">#</a><a href="http://www.wilug.org">wilug</a> standby, "I'm kind of a big deal around here."
