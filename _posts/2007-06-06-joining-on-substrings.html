<a href="http://jonathanlewis.wordpress.com/">Jonathan Lewis</a> shared an example of joining two tables where the joining field on table is comprised of two fields on the other table.  The original poster thought he'd need to re-design his table, but <a href="http://jonathanlewis.wordpress.com/2007/06/05/design/">Jonathan proved otherwise</a> with the grace and efficiency of a true Englishman.<br /><br />Definitely good to know!
