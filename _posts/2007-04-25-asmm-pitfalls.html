Earlier this month, Jonathan Lewis <a href="http://jonathanlewis.wordpress.com/2007/04/16/sga-resizing/">revisited</a> an <a href="http://jonathanlewis.wordpress.com/2006/12/04/resizing-the-sga/">earlier post</a> of his about the problems of automatic SGA management.  It was a great read, and one all too near to (and a <a href="http://www.freelists.org/archives/oracle-l/04-2007/msg00351.html">wound so fresh</a> in) my heart.  I've yet to actually find a bug number to confirm the suggestion, other than Note 396940.1 in Metalink.  It lists as a possible problem:<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><blockquote><span style="font-weight: bold;">High parse ratios</span><br /><br />It is important to identify what could produce high parsing calls:<br /><br />- Use of dynamic plsql<br />- Execution of DDL statements during periods of high workload. Every<br />time a DDL statement is executed, it will cause invalidation of all<br />the statements referencing the object involved. Next time a sql<br />statement referencing the object is executed, it will have to be<br />reparsed and loaded into the shared pool.<br /><br />Typical operations that cause this situation is the execution of:<br /><br />- Grant/revoke command<br />- Alter view<br />- Alter package | procedure<br />- Analyze table |index<br />- DBMS_STATS<br />- Truncate table<br />- Alter index<br />- Alter table move<br /><br />If an ORA-04031 error is associated with high parse ratios, you will<br />also see latch contention for the library cache latch as well as<br />indications of lots of invalidations and reloads in the Library Cache<br />statists in a Statspack or AWR report.</blockquote>Seems to fit my situation perfectly, although 2:30 AM isn't a high usage period for me, which might suggest a bug after all.
