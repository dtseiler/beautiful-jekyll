Passed the 1Z0-043 exam today, otherwise known as the OCP exam.  Just need <a href="http://education.oracle.com/pls/web_prod-plq-dad/db_pages.getpage?page_id=151">some other jazz</a> like my hands-on course requirement form to be processed and then I should get my badge and gun and key to the executive washroom.<br /><br />Thanks to Bradd Piontek for reminding me of how silly it all is, inspiring me to pass it even more so that I wouldn't look even more foolish failing a silly exam.
