Much like <a href="http://halisway.blogspot.com">hali</a>, I have a preternatural dislike for <a href="http://www.quest.com/toad/">Toad</a>.  There really is no valid reason for it, though, so I won't try to justify it.  I just don't dig it.  Equally unjustifiable is my preference for Oracle's own <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technology/products/database/sql_developer/index.html">SQL Developer</a>, especially now that it gives me a point-and-click interface for killing sessions.  Well perhaps I can provide <span style="font-style: italic;">some</span> justification in that Oracle SQL Developer comes packaged with <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technology/software/tech/java/sqlj_jdbc/index.html">ojdbc</a> so I don't need to install anything else to run it other than the <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp">JDK</a>.  It's also completely free.<br /><br />One thing that I had yet to do was add some of my own reports to the mix, and thanks to my <a href="http://ora.seiler.us/2007/04/heart-of-darkness.html">previously-mentioned</a> savior, <a href="http://www.ittoolbox.com/profiles/lewiscunningham">Lewis Cunningham</a>, I've begun that.  Lewis has a <a href="http://blogs.ittoolbox.com/oracle/guide/archives/sql-developer-reports-15860">nice PDF on how to write reports for SQL Developer</a>, from basic table output to child (drill-down) reports to pie/bar/line charts.
