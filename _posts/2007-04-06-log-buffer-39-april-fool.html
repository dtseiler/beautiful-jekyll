Hullo and welcome to this week's edition of the <a href="http://www.pythian.com/blogs/about-log-buffer/">Log Buffer</a>!  A very special thanks to Dave Edwards at <a href="http://www.pythian.com/">Pythian</a> for this opportunity.  Now let's begin ...<br /><br />The man, the myth, the legend <a href="http://tkyte.blogspot.com/">Tom Kyte</a> shared some insight into a new SQL feature under consideration for Oracle: <a href="http://tkyte.blogspot.com/2007/04/so-in-your-opinion.html">pattern matching over partitioned, ordered rows</a>.  He's asking for readers to offer up their opinion, so get to it!  <a href="http://pjsrandom.wordpress.com/2007/04/04/pattern-matching/">Pete did so</a> on <a href="http://pjsrandom.wordpress.com/">his blog</a> as well.<br /><br />Tom also just posted a lengthy write-up of some of the <a href="http://tkyte.blogspot.com/2007/04/when-explanation-doesn-sound-quite.html">caveats to be aware of when using "explain plan"</a>.<br /><br />Sachin, broadcasting live from his blog <a href="http://oracle-online-help.blogspot.com/index.html">Oracle Online Help</a>, has posted a nice primer on the differences between three join types that anyone who has ever look at a query plan will be familiar with: <a href="http://oracle-online-help.blogspot.com/2007/03/nested-loops-hash-join-and-sort-merge.html">nested loops, hash joins, and sort-merge joins</a>.<br /><br />Oracle ACE <a href="http://www.dbazine.com/blogs/blog-cf/cf-bio">Chris Foot</a> at dbazine.com generously shared with us <a href="http://www.dbazine.com/blogs/blog-cf/chrisfoot/blogentry.2007-03-31.3616747160">his top 10g tuning tools</a>.<br /><br />Kevin Closson posted a postive <a href="http://kevinclosson.wordpress.com/2007/04/03/oracle11g-new-feature-look-like-good-stuff-not-just-a-world-domination-play/">preview of things to come in Oracle 11g</a>, as well as Oracle's approach.<br /><br />Pete Finnigan, via his Oracle Security blog, posted two bits of worrisome information: a <a href="http://www.petefinnigan.com/weblog/archives/00001029.htm">0-day Oracle exploit</a> and an <a href="http://www.petefinnigan.com/weblog/archives/00001030.htm">Oracle rootkit</a> are out and about.<br /><br />Those of you interested in <a href="http://oracletoday.blogspot.com/2007/04/new-case-study-has-been-published-in.html">Oracle client-side load balancing</a> might want to head over to yas' <a href="http://oracletoday.blogspot.com/">Oracle Today</a>.<br /><br />Robert Vollman at <a href="http://thinkoracle.blogspot.com/">oracleblog</a> snuck in <a href="http://thinkoracle.blogspot.com/2007/04/oracle-beefs.html">a few Oracle beefs</a>, and also gives a positive mention of this blog!  Huzzah!<br /><br />Coskan Gundogar, from <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeQ-wjDH4F4&mode=related&amp;search=">Istanbul (not Constantinople)</a>, has some <a href="http://coskan.wordpress.com/2007/04/05/my-approach-to-dba-business-questions-to-a-new-graduate/">questions for new graduates</a> that think they'd like to be DBAs.<br /><br />Switching away from Oracle to MySQL, Brian "Krow" Aker posted some hot news about a <a href="http://krow.livejournal.com/502908.html">Postgres storage engine for MySQL</a>.  It seemed an open-source enthusiasts utopia, until everyone realized <a href="http://krow.livejournal.com/503381.html">what day it was</a> (although I was ready to buy one of <a href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/stuff/41/lebedev.shtml">these</a>).<br /><br />The folks at <a href="http://hackmysql.com/wp/">HackMySQL</a> share with us a script for <a href="http://hackmysql.com/wp/2007/03/31/checking-mysql-databasetables-for-unused-indexes-mysqlidxchk/">checking databases or tables for unused indexes</a>: <a href="http://hackmysql.com/mysqlidxchk">mysqlidxchk</a>.<br /><br />The aforementioned Tom Kyte even <a href="http://tkyte.blogspot.com/2007/04/neat-error-message.html">shared a recent MySQL experience</a> with us, and Pythian's Paul Vallee shared a <a href="http://www.pythian.com/blogs/423/oracles-tom-kyte-on-mysql-error-messages-and-sorting-rules">similar experience</a>.  Neither bode well for the MySQL fans in the audience.<br /><br /><span class="post-footers">Zack Urlocker at <a href="http://www.theopenforce.com/">TheOpenForce.com</a> writes that </span><a href="http://www.theopenforce.com/2007/04/how_does_youtub.html">Paul Tuckfield from YouTube will be giving a talk at an upcoming MySQL conference</a> on how <a href="http://www.youtube.com/">YouTube</a> scales with MySQL.<br /><br /><a href="http://jcole.us/blog/">Jeremy Cole</a> opened our eyes to a <a href="http://jcole.us/blog/archives/2007/04/04/temporary-tables-for-show-variables-in-mysql-50/">more efficient alternative to MySQL's SHOW VARIABLES</a>.<br /><br />Fans, or even casual acquaintances, of MySQL replication will find joy in <a href="http://www.mysqlperformanceblog.com/about/">Peter Zaitsev</a>'s <a href="http://www.mysqlperformanceblog.com/2007/04/05/mysql-master-master-replication-manager-released/">coverage of the MySQL Master-Master Replication Manager</a>.  You'll also definitely want to help out MySQL's own <a href="http://www.planetmysql.org/robin/">Robin Schumacher</a> and give him some <a href="http://www.planetmysql.org/robin/?p=39">feedback on replication monitoring</a>.<br /><br />Our PostgreSQL fans will have surely seen <a href="http://people.planetpostgresql.org/xzilla/">Robert "xzilla" Treat</a>'s tip at PlanetPostgreSQL about <a href="http://people.planetpostgresql.org/xzilla/index.php?/archives/295-Monthly-log-rotations-with-PostgreSQLs-built-in-logging.html">monthly log rotation with PostgreSQL's built-in logging</a>.<br /><br />Both "<a href="http://drsql.spaces.live.com/Blog/cns%2180677FB08B3162E4%211603.entry">The SQL Doctor</a>" and <a href="http://www.sqlskills.com/blogs/kimberly/2007/04/02/SQLServer2005BooksOnlineScopedSearch.aspx">Kimberly Tripp</a> posted about <a href="http://search.live.com/macros/sql_server_user_education/booksonline">Microsoft SQL Server 2005's online book search</a>.<br /><br /><a href="http://decipherinfosys.wordpress.com/">Decipher Information Systems' blog</a> had an interesting post contrasting <a href="http://decipherinfosys.wordpress.com/2007/04/03/computed-columns/">MS SQL Server and Oracle with regard to computed columns</a>.<br /><br />Craig Mullins, host of the DB2 Portal Blog, wrote about a couple of tricks and treats in DB2.  First up was <a href="http://www.db2portal.com/2007/03/mimicking-rownum-in-db2.html">mimicking ROWNUM in DB2</a>, followed later in the week by a <a href="http://www.db2portal.com/2007/04/intersect-and-except-db2-9-for-zos.html">treatise on INTERSECT and EXCEPT</a> in DB2.  But he didn't stop there, and returning readers were rewarded with a <a href="http://www.db2portal.com/2007/04/order-by-and-fetch-first-in-subselects.html">review of ORDER BY and FETCH FIRST in DB2 subselects</a>.  And just when I thought I was out, he pulls me back in with a write-up on <a href="http://www.db2portal.com/2007/04/native-xml-support-in-db2-databases-db2.html">DB2's native XML support</a>!<br /><br />Over at <a href="http://blogs.ittoolbox.com/database/db2zos">his ITtoolbox blog</a>, Willie Favero asks <a href="http://blogs.ittoolbox.com/database/db2zos/archives/to-log-or-not-to-log-could-this-even-be-a-question-15515">a question that probably shouldn't be asked</a>.<br /><br />And I think we'll end this edition of the Log Buffer right there.  Probably fitting that I host the April Fool's week issue!  I do apologize for the lack of PostgreSQL coverage, not a lot came across my desk this week.  It only serves to remind me to make some time to play with PostgreSQL!<br /><br />I hope you've enjoyed your stay at my meager blog and will return again to read about my many misadventures as I stumble into more Oracle parameters that I've let go <a href="http://seilerwerks.blogspot.com/2007/04/pga-not-just-for-caddyshack-2-fans.html">untuned</a> for years!  For those of you who have made it this far, I'll reward you with some footage of <a href="http://seilerhaus.blogspot.com/2007/03/what-does-horse-say.html">my son's horse impression</a>.  Have a great weekend!
