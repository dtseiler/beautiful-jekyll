Jon Emmons over at <a href="http://www.lifeaftercoffee.com/">Life After Coffee</a>, a blog of linux tips and tricks, has posted some <a href="http://www.lifeaftercoffee.com/2007/05/02/more-linux-and-unix-find-command-options/">tips for the "find" command</a>.  Nothing new for myself, although his tip of redirecting STDERR to /dev/null to avoid having my terminal polluted with "Permission denied" errors is something that brightened my day, so I thought I'd share it with YOU.  <3
