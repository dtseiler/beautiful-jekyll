You'll have to forgive my obtuseness.  I only ever log into my Oracle servers as "oracle" and am able to login locally with<br /><br /><span style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0);font-family:courier new;" >$ sqlplus / as sysdba</span><br />or<br /><span style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0);font-family:courier new;" >$ sqlplus dts</span><br /><br />So today I was a little scared when I couldn't do this from an OS user other than oracle.  The $ORACLE_SID variable was indeed set correctly.  After quite a bit of hot Google action it turns out that <a href="http://download.oracle.com/docs/cd/B19306_01/server.102/b14357/qstart.htm#SQPUG004">sqlplus still uses the TWO_TASK environment variable</a>.  For some reason I had assumed it was deprecated and/or obsolete since I had never had to use it.<br /><br />Sometimes it helps to step down from the mountaintop for a clearer view.
