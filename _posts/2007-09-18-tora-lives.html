And I had just spoken with someone last week about how <a href="http://tora.sourceforge.net/">TOra</a> was dead.  Then they come out with a <a href="https://sourceforge.net/project/shownotes.php?release_id=540345&amp;group_id=16636">new release</a>.<br /><br />This was one of my pet projects to maintain back when I worked for <a href="http://www.gentoo.org">Gentoo</a>.  A nice alternative to TOAD for those of us fighting to keep our linux desktops.
