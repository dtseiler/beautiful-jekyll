With the <a href="http://googlereader.blogspot.com/2010/11/welcome-google-apps-users.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed:+blogspot/dtKx+(Official+Google+Reader+Blog)&amp;utm_content=Google+Reader">recent announcement of Google Apps for Domains integration with the rest of the Google tools suite</a>, I've decided to further simplify my life and run this blog on Google's blogger utility. I've been considering coming back for a while, given that Wordpress doesn't let me do everything I want (e.g. Amazon associate links) and now Blogger does what I wanted before (e.g. Pages).<br /><div><br /></div><div>The big task now is to find a way to import from Wordpress to Blogger. I can import everything from my previous Blogger blog, but might have to manually copy posts since then (3 years ago). I don't know that there are that many since then, so it might not be too bad. Plus I'm on vacation this week.</div>
