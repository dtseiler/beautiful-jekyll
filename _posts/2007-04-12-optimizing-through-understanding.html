Early last month <a href="http://jonathanlewis.wordpress.com/">Jonathan Lewis</a> put up a great <a href="http://jonathanlewis.wordpress.com/2007/03/05/web-presentation/">web presentation</a> called "<a href="http://oukc.oracle.com/static05/opn/oracle9i_database/022607_1000/022607_1000_source/022607_1000/index.htm">Optimizing through Understanding</a>."  I only just got around to viewing it, and it's packed with good stuff on breaking down queries and rewriting queries to find and hint for the best query plans available.
