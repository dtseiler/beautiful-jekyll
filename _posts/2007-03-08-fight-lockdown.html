It's come up before, but it had been so long that I had nearly forgotten it.  "It" is the serious permissions lockdown after installing Oracle RDBMS >= 9i.  Someone <a href="http://www.madisonlinux.org/pipermail/madlug/2007-February/013967.html">brought it up</a> on the <a href="http://www.madisonlinux.org/">MADLUG</a> list earlier this year, and I vaguely remembered that it was fixed in Oracle 10g 10.2.0.2.  What I had forgotten was that it was fixed in the form of a script that needed to be run post-install.<br /><br />I should say "fixed" because it's only a problem if you want non-oracle/oinstall users to use utilities like sqlplus locally.  Not totally unheard-of by any means, but some people really lock down their servers, and would prefer the tight perms.<br /><br />Anyway, the script is <tt>$ORACLE_HOME/install/changePerm.sh</tt>, and it will loosen things up for normal OS users.
