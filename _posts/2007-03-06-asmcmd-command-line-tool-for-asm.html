I received a HOT tip yesterday about the existence of <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technology/oramag/oracle/06-mar/o26asm.html">asmcmd</a>.  Frankly I'm ashamed that I didn't know about it sooner, since I've been doing an <span style="font-style: italic;">ass-ton</span> of reading about ASM over the past month or so.  I'd commit <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seppuku">seppuku</a> but I don't have a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaishakunin">trusty second</a> available.  Instead, I'll just share this post with you as my penance.<br /><br /><a href="http://download-east.oracle.com/docs/cd/B19306_01/server.102/b14215/asm_util.htm">asmcmd</a> basically provides a command-line interface to the ASM "file system".  Since ASM uses raw disk, traditional OS tools are powerless to view the precious files within.  asmcmd lets you navigate the contents of your ASM instance's disk groups with commands that should be familiar to any Linux user, including wildcard matching.
