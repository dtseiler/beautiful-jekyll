If you're using <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technology/deploy/availability/htdocs/rman_overview.htm">RMAN</a> to take your backups, and are running <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technology/products/database/oracle10g/index.html">Oracle 10g</a>, do yourself a favor and enable <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technology/oramag/oracle/04-nov/o64rman.html">block change tracking</a> <span style="font-style: italic;">now</span>.  Prior to doing so, my level 1 incremental backups were scanning my entire database (~830 GB) and took over 5 hours.  With BCT, level 1 incremental backups only look at around 45 GB (according to <a href="http://halisway.blogspot.com/2006/12/monitoring-rman-io-performance.html">v$rman_backup_job_details</a>) and often take less than 30 minutes.<br /><br />The one caveat is to watch for the overhead incurred, but we haven't seen any noticeable performance hit.<br /><br />Of course my level 0 still takes over 9 hours, but I'm hoping to (re)implement <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technology/oramag/oracle/04-nov/o64rman.html">incremental merge</a> and only take one level 0 to start and never look back.
