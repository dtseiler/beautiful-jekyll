Finally got around to installing the <a href="http://www.cxtools.net/default.aspx?nav=cxorlb" rel="tag">cx_Oracle</a> lib for <a href="http://www.python.org/" rel="tag">python</a>.  Since my <a href="http://www.oracle.com/" rel="tag">Oracle</a> sandbox at work is only <a href="http://www.centos.org/" rel="tag">CentOS</a>3 (to be as close to prod <a href="http://www.redhat.com/rhel/" rel="tag">RHEL</a>3 as possible), I only have python 2.2, so I needed to build/install from source.  Sadly, I didn't realize how trivial this was, but it's done now, and I can further my python fanboidom AND play with Oracle at the same time.<br /><br />To quote <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077975/" rel="tag">Animal House</a>: THANK YOU, GOD.
