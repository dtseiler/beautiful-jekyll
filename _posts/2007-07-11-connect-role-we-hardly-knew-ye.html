I knew that <a href="http://ora.seiler.us/2007/02/role-showdown-connect-vs-resource.html">in Oracle 10gR2, the CONNECT role had been stripped down</a> to only provide the CREATE SESSION privilege.  I did not, however, know that <a href="http://download.oracle.com/docs/cd/B19306_01/server.102/b14238/upgrade.htm#sthref139">Oracle had officially deprecated the CONNECT role</a>.<br /><br />Count me among the <a href="http://radiofreetooting.blogspot.com/2007/07/dont-only-connect.html">lazy DBAs that Andrew Clarke is referring to</a>.  :p
