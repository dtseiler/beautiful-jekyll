See what I did there?  5 points to anyone who can name the reference.  10 points if you can name the original reference that I wasn't even thinking of.  Void where prohibited.<br /><br />Sachin, broadcasting live from his blog <a href="http://oracle-online-help.blogspot.com/index.html">Oracle Online Help</a>, has posted a nice primer on the differences between three join types that anyone who has ever look at a query plan will be familiar with: <a href="http://oracle-online-help.blogspot.com/2007/03/nested-loops-hash-join-and-sort-merge.html">nested loops, hash joins, and sort-merge joins</a>.<br /><br />I definitely sleep a little better knowing what these mean.  Now if only I knew what everything else meant.
