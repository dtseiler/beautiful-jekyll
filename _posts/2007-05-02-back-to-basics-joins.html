Eddie Awad has an <a href="http://awads.net/wp/2006/03/16/back-to-basics-cross-joins/">excellent series</a> on the various join syntaxes, demonstrating both in the "old" Oracle syntax as well as the standard ANSI <a href="http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/%7Eshadow/sql/sql1992.txt">SQL92</a> syntax.  Now you can get your head around inner vs outer joins and all the rest!<br /><br />I'm going to make an effort to switch to the ANSI syntax for all the reasons that he lists.
