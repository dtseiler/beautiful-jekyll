I thought it might be helpful for those also interested in taking the <a href="http://education.oracle.com/pls/web_prod-plq-dad/db_pages.getpage?page_id=41&p_exam_id=1Z0_042">OCA examination</a> to describe how I prepared for it.<br /><br />First of all, I've been in the position of Oracle database administrator for 6 years.  Practical experience is much more easy to recall than text from a book.<br /><br />When I expressed my goal of getting OCA and OCP certifications, my employer was very supportive.  At my request, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0072257903?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=dieseilerw-20&linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0072257903">Oracle 10g OCP Certification All-in-One Exam Guide</a> was ordered.  This guide was a good read, although it was written prior to 10gR2, and so some of the contents were already outdated.  This book also came with a practice exam that I didn't feel was too bad, although it covered <a href="http://download.oracle.com/docs/cd/B19306_01/server.102/b14220/mgmt_db.htm#sthref2259">Resource Manager</a>, which was not on the OCA exam, nor in my other study guides.<br /><br />This January, my employer sent me to the <a href="http://education.oracle.com/pls/web_prod-plq-dad/show_desc.redirect?dc=D17090GC30&p_org_id=&amp;lang=&amp;source_call=">Oracle DBA Workshop</a>, the class recommended for the OCA.  This class assumes zero knowledge of Oracle, so the majority of it was review, but there were a few nuggets of gold that I put into practice at work.  Just to note, the class is not required for the OCA (unlike the <a href="http://education.oracle.com/web_prod-plq-dad/plsql/show_desc.redirect?dc=D17312GC20">Workshop II</a> class being required for the OCP).<br /><br />My employer also bought the <a href="http://education.oracle.com/pls/web_prod-plq-dad/show_desc.redirect?dc=D21172">self-study CDs</a> for this workshop.  I went through those over the two weeks prior to the exam.<br /><br />Obviously these things all cost a bit of money, and my employer thankfully covered the cost of all media and training.  Hopefully this helps someone out.
