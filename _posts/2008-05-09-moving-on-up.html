Today is my last day at my current employer.  It has been an incredible learning experience, and I'll be forever grateful to <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/2/4b4/413">the man</a> who gave me the opportunity almost 7 years ago having zero knowledge of either Oracle or database administration.<br /><br />I have accepted an offer from noted consulting firm <a href="http://www.pythian.com/">The Pythian Group</a> to join their staff of DBAs doing remote administration.  This new position should give me exposure to a diverse set of client environments and configurations and a chance to grow in this career path and learn from some of the best in the business.  I will be flying out on Sunday for a 3-week stint at the worldwide headquarters in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada to immerse myself in the Pythian way.  If I have free time with my nights I hope to finish porting <a href="http://leaguesite.sourceforge.net/">LeagueSite</a> to <a href="http://www.drupal.org/">drupal</a>.<br /><br />I'll also try to get more regular with the blogging.  Things have been a bit hectic as of late.
