If you're reading this, then the migration has worked. My blog is now hosted via [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). Many thanks to Kris Rice for his [Blogger migration blog post](http://krisrice.io/2017-10-06-migrating-my-blog-from-blogger-to-github-pages-with-jekyll/) and [source code](https://github.com/krisrice/krisrice.io) to get me set.

I might move some other stuff under this site as well, namely my notes currently over at [kb.seiler.us](http://kb.seiler.us).
