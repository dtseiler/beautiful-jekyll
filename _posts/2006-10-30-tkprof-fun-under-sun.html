I've just recently opened the pandora's box that is <a href="http://www.adp-gmbh.ch/ora/tuning/tkprof/index.html">tkprof</a>, as soon as I get a grasp of it, I plan to write about it in this space.  Actually reading that link, along with the <a href="http://download-east.oracle.com/docs/cd/B19306_01/server.102/b14211/sqltrace.htm#sthref2019">official documentation</a>, will give you a pretty good idea on how to use it.<br /><br />Now if only I could get a grasp on <a href="http://www.dizwell.com/prod/node/332">this problem</a>.
