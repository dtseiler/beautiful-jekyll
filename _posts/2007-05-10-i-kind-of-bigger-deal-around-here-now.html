Eddie Awad recently <a href="http://awads.net/wp/2007/05/09/top-oracle-blogs-ranked-by-technorati-authority/">posted about some new Technorati "Authority" rankings</a> for blogs included in his Oracle blog news aggregator, <a href="http://orana.info/">OraNA</a>.  Well I gave Eddie the sad puppy-dog-eyes and he graciously has added this blog to the collective.<br /><br />Now I just need some suckers to add me to their favorites ... <a href="http://technorati.com/faves?sub=addfavbtn&amp;add=http://ora.seiler.us"><img alt="Add to Technorati Favorites" src="http://static.technorati.com/pix/fave/tech-fav-1.png" /></a>
