A few months ago I was doing some testing on a development PostgreSQL database and watching the postgresql server log (akin to Oracle's alert log). I was skimming for lines relevant to my testing when I noticed something chilling:<br /><br /><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">LOG:&nbsp; statement: alter user john password 'IloveDBAs';</span><br /><br />The username and password have obviously been changed but the point is plain: PostgreSQL printed the password value in plain text to the log file. A few tests of my own confirmed that whenever the PASSWORD specification is used in a CREATE USER or ALTER USER command, it will be printed to the server log:<br /><br /><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">LOG:&nbsp; statement: create user john password 'badidea';</span><br /><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">LOG:&nbsp; statement: alter user john password 'alsobad';</span><br /><div><br /></div><div>The way around this in psql is to use the \PASSWORD command. When creating a new user, do not specify the password at creation time, just use \PASSWORD later:</div><div><br /></div><div><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;"># create user susan;</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">CREATE ROLE</span></div><div><div><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;"># \password susan</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">Enter new password:</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">Enter it again:</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;"># \password john</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">Enter new password:</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">Enter it again:</span></div></div><div><br /></div><div>Now, like most password-change processes, you're asked to enter it twice and the input is not echoed to the screen. The log will show this:</div><div><br /></div><div><div><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">LOG:&nbsp; statement: create user susan;</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">LOG:&nbsp; statement: ALTER USER susan PASSWORD 'md5d311d09782068f6a2391358ae512e113'</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">LOG:&nbsp; statement: ALTER USER john PASSWORD 'md5a7e4187c1c977ed2e700e880dac11f15'</span></div></div><div><br /></div><div>You can see the passwords are still printed, but they are md5-hashed now.</div><div><br /></div><div>However, this only works when I'm using psql. If a developer is using a GUI tool that offers a feature to change a password, they could very well be doing the same bad command under the hood.</div><div><br /></div><div>Note: this behavior was originally observed by me in PostgreSQL 9.2 but it's still the case in 9.6 and 10.2. From <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/message-id/CAHJZqBDe1-oiYtdh5pcWLAhr3jsDMFQg4miv3PYADH3YWKqZ2w%40mail.gmail.com" target="_blank">a discussion that was had with the pgsql-admin community</a>, it's not likely to be changed any time soon.</div>

<h3>Update</h3>
<p>Backfilling some helpful comments from the original blog post that were lost in migration.</p>
<p>Jeremy Scheider writes:
<blockquote>
<p>I suspect that you don't want the md5 hashes to get logged either. This might be a good read:</p>

<p>https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/41064/is-postgres-password-based-authentication-secure</p>

<p>comment on that link: "The hash in the pg_shadow table is now a password equivalent. When an attackers steals this table (we assume this will happen eventually), she just uses any hash for authentication without even spending time to crack md5."</p>

and Stephen Frost adds:
<blockquote>
The real answer to this is to use the new SCRAM authentication method added in PostgreSQL v10, or to use a better authentication method such as Kerberos/GSSAPI or Client-Side Certificates.
