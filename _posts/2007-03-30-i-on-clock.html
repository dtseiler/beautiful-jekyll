<a href="http://padraigs.blogspot.com">Padraig O'Sullivan</a> has posted the <a href="http://padraigs.blogspot.com/2007/03/log-buffer-38-carnival-of-vanities-for.html">latest edition</a> of <a href="http://www.pythian.com/blogs/about-log-buffer">Pythian's Log Buffer</a>, a weekly recap of Oracle blogger activity.  The <a href="http://www.pythian.com/">Pythian Group</a> has been letting various bloggers host the Log Buffer from week-to-week.  This next week (ending 6 April), I'll be hosting the Log Buffer.  This also means I'll have to be on the lookout for <a href="http://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a>, <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a> and <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/sql/default.mspx">MSSQL Server</a> content!<br /><br />Hopefully I can carry the torch and keep the flame burning and whatever other metaphors one can think of.<br /><br />Also, both of my readers may have noticed that I haven't posted that much this week.  Alas, my duties as president of the <a href="http://www.mufc.us">Manitowoc Ultimate Frisbee Concern</a> have been pulling me away from the blogging.  We're <a href="http://www.mufc.us/node/16">organizing a tournament</a> that we're hoping will be a success, and I've been focusing on drafting a sponsorship proposal to get funds and goodies for the players.  Hopefully this thing is a hit with everyone and we rock it every year.
