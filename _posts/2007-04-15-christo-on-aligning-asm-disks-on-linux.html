As I sit here on a <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=kb-Q_ofBDh0">Sunday morning</a> waiting for some disk issues to be resolved in my datacenter, I took the time to catch up on some <a href="http://del.icio.us/rizzo/readme">pages I had marked for later reading</a>.  One was a post by <a href="http://www.pythian.com/blogs/author/kutrovsky/">Christo Kutrovsky</a> from the <a href="http://www.pythian.com/">Pythian Group</a>, about <a href="http://www.pythian.com/blogs/411/aligning-asm-disks-on-linux">aligning ASM disks on linux</a>, to avoid misalignments due to odd default offsets in linux that might cause I/O for relatively small amounts of data to be inefficiently split across disks.<br /><br />Also now I can't help but look at "Christo Kutrovsky" and think of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krusty_the_Clown">Krusty the Clown</a>, a.k.a. Herschel Krustofski.
