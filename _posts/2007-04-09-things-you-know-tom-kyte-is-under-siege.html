A couple of weeks ago I "attended" a webcast from IOUG by <a href="http://tkyte.blogspot.com/">Tom Kyte</a> entitled "Things You Know".  You can find the <a href="http://www.ioug.org/services/webcast/things_you_know.zip">presentation materials online</a> (you might need <a href="http://www.wmplugins.com/ItemDetail.aspx?&codec=G2M3">these codecs</a>).  It was a great session with Tom focusing on the dangers of what people <span style="font-style: italic;">think</span> they know to be true versus what reality is.  "Trust, but verify" rings loud and clear throughout.<br /><br />One thing that I wrote down in my notes was a reference Tom made to "<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000219/">Steven Seagal</a> and his <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116421/">many</a> <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120786/">great</a> <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114781/">movies</a>."  I don't know Tom's personality at all, but he seems like a pretty straight-shooting guy, so I'm not sure if this was sarcasm or not.  It seriously has me worried.  At least once a day (usually during my 45-minute commute) I wonder if he was serious or not.  Am I the only one?
