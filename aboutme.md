Hi. I'm Don. 

## Work
I work mostly with databases, currently PostgreSQL, formerly Oracle. I do a fair amount of bash scripting to help with that, although I enjoy coding in python as well.

## Play
I devote a lot of my personal time to [youth hockey](http://www.manitowochockey.org). I also play more [Dota2](http://www.dota2.com) than a grown man should.

## Live
I was born, raised and moved back to Manitowoc, Wisconsin, USA. Wife & kids. Dog. House. The whole deal.
